# Chess Engine - PWS
A chess engine for our PWS.
## About
This chess engine is Lisa Vrins, Kuno Zeldenrust and Anbiya Popal's PWS (profielwerkstsuk) project. 
## (Planned) features
When this is finished, we want it to have the following features:

* Chess engine capable of playing at a mid-high level (it can beat players with a rating of Â±1600)

* [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) support so it can compete against other bots (or real players) online

* Python [arcade](https://arcade.academy/) GUI to play chess without UCI
