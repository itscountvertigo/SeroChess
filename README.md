A chess engine for our PWS.

## About
This chess engine is Lisa Vrins, Kuno Zeldenrust and Anbiya Popal's PWS (profielwerkstsuk) project. 

## (Planned) features
When this is finished, we want it to have the following features:

* Chess engine capable of playing at a mid-high level

* [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) supported version

* Python [arcade](https://arcade.academy/) GUI to play chess without UCI
